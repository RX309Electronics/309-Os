This software is free and unlicensed but i would still like it and it would be kind of you if you put some credit of me the creator When you distribute the software to the internet, like making a video about it. I will be happy when you put either the link to my github or my project in the description or put "Made by: 309Electronics" in the description. I am just a hobbyist and would like to get a bit more attention from the general public so if you could, please credit me, it would help me a lot and would make my motivation not fade away.

I live in the Netherlands in Eindhoven in a small village called 'acht' I am a highschool student Who likes electronics and coding. i am pretty proud of my work! Please dont expect amazing quality or criticise some things i do or neat code because my motto is "If it works dont touch it" and i am just a hobbyist and not a profesional.

If there are any problems, bugs or you can provide tips please email me to 309Projectscustomerline@gmail.com (long email adres, i know!). Please know that apart from coding and doing the things i like, i also am still a student and have school 5 days in the week + homework to do so i might not always check the customer line/have time to do so. Please be patient and i will always react with a thank you mail or a "got it". I hope you like this project and feel free to scroll through my github page full of (dumb) projects. :)

This repo contains Linux things for 309-Os a (individual) project i started myself where i compile and build my own embedded Linux distro without relying on premade distro's by big companies. I do compilation things on Ubuntu/Linux mint. My linux distro IS NOT meant as a big used/big profit distro, its just a (simple) fun project i can work on to keep me busy and allows me to dip my toes in the Linux landscape and lets me dive deep into the world of linux. Also it wont be perfect and probably will have some bugs but i'll try to fix as much as i can.
